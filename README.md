# UnityScripts
Unity scripts written in C# used to control both camera and player in a 2.5D RPG game.

Source code
-----------
Source code is written in English but commented in Spanish.

It handles player movement with the combination of Vertical and Horizontal inputs.
Camera movement must be set with 45º and 60º (videogame-like isometric view).

-----------
Added a Master that handles a Battle system. All players try to get first to the turn queue, and join it depending on their cooldown bars. After that, the system simulates an action.
